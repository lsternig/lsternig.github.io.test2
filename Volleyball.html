        <main><p>Throughout my life sports have been a staple of my life. From a young age I jumped into every sporting contest I could find. Spending time playing baseball, basketball, soccer, and football in my adolesent years. However, as I started to grow up my interested started to change toward less common sports. In high school I started my volleyball career and I never looked back. I was a two year capitain of our varsity team, and helped to lead our school to two sectional championships. </p>
