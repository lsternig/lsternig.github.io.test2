        <main><p>I grew up with a family that never sat still. As the youngest of 3, there was always an event to be at or something to fix. One thing that has been passed down for several generations in my family is working with your hands. My great grandfather worked on a farm, my grandfather a sculpter and whittled in his free time, and my father was a typical "Home Depot Dad" - fix anything that broke with the snap of a finger. Becuase of these generations of creative laborers, I learned from a young age how to make awesome things with hard materials. The material I enjoy working wiht the most is wood. In my free time I enjoy checking the Restore for unique styles of wood, or designing something that would look cool above my tv. No matter what the situation, I always find comfort in spending some thinking of my next project.</p>
